Portals in the Keywright's Gallery have opened, allowing the player and the Harvester access.",
        part3: "After equipping a weapon, the player follows Norianwe out of the opening area. They learn that mixing weapons won't allow them to progress, and they can loot urns for items before leaving. Norianwe provides combat training, and the player can choose to practice again.

        name: "Leveling guide",
        part1: " The leveling system in The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) revolves around gaining experience points (XP) to advance your character's level and progress through the game. Here's a breakdown of how the leveling system works in ESO:",
        part2: "Character Level: Your character's level represents their overall progression in the game. As you earn experience points from completing quests, defeating enemies, exploring the world, and other activities, your character will gradually gain levels. The maximum level cap in ESO is currently 50.",
        part3 : "Attribute Points: As your character levels up, you'll earn attribute points that can be allocated to increase your Health, Magicka, or Stamina. These attributes affect your character's survivability, magical abilities, and physical prowess, respectively. You can distribute attribute points according to your preferred playstyle and build.",
        part4 : "Skill Points: In addition to attribute points, you'll also earn skill points as you level up. Skill points can be spent to unlock and upgrade various abilities in your character's skill lines. Each class, weapon type, armor type, and crafting profession has its own skill line, offering a wide range of abilities and playstyles to choose from.",
        part5 : "Skill Lines: Skill lines represent the different abilities and passives that your character can acquire throughout the game. By using specific weapons, wearing certain types of armor, or engaging in particular activities like crafting, you'll progress in the corresponding skill lines and unlock new abilities. Skill lines can be leveled up by gaining experience in the associated activities or by spending skill points to unlock new abilities and passives.",
        part6 : "Champion Points (CP): Once you reach level 50, your character will start earning Champion Points instead of traditional experience points. Champion Points are account-wide and can be spent in the Champion System to further customize and enhance your character's abilities. Champion Points are divided into different constellations, each offering unique bonuses and passives that can be unlocked as you accumulate more points.",
        part7 : "Level Scaling: ESO features a level-scaling system that adjusts the difficulty of enemies and content based on your character's level. This means that you can explore any area of the game world at any level, and the enemies you encounter will scale to match your level. This allows for a more flexible and open-ended gameplay experience, where you're not restricted to specific zones based on your level.",
        part8 : "Overall, the leveling system in ESO is designed to provide players with a sense of progression and customization as they develop their characters' skills, abilities, and attributes. Whether you prefer questing, dungeon delving, PvP combat, or crafting, there are plenty of opportunities to earn experience and advance your character in The Elder Scrolls Online.",
